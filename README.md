# `finallycoffee.service` ansible collection

## Overview

This ansible collection is used as a pool of roles with no clear assigned scope,
and serves as a catch-all for ansible roles which do not fit into a clear
concise area of concern.

## Roles

- [`roles/restic-s3`](roles/restic-s3/README.md): Manage backups using restic
  and persist them to an s3-compatible backend.
